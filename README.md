# Object_Detection_Computer_Vision
---
- This is the guide to different type of **object detection from python and OpenCV**.
- A beginner who is making a way into computer vision on the basis of object detection
    can utilize it as self learning tool and professionals who are working in the 
    object detection using OpenCv can take a bit help too.
- This repository includes following object detection topics with OpenCV

       1.Contour Detection
       2.Edge Detection
       3.Corner Detection
       4.Face Detection
       5.Feature Matching
       6.Grid Detection
       7.Template Matching
       8.Watershed Algorithm (Image Segmentation algorithm)
       9.Russian License Plate Detection and Blur (Haar Cascades trained file on Russian number plates)
       10.Fingers Detection and Fingers counting in real time.
